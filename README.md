📌 Overview
This project is a Steam-inspired game search engine built as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course project.
The goal is to design an efficient system that allows users to search, filter, and sort games using classic data structures and algorithms instead of brute force chaos.
It focuses more on logic and performance than fancy UI.

🎯 Features
Add and store game records

Search games by:
Name
Genre

Sorting options like:
Alphabetical order
Rating-based sorting
Fast searching using optimized data structures
Simple and easy-to-understand flow

🧠 Data Structures Used
Arrays / Lists for storing game data
Hash Tables for fast lookups
Trees (if implemented) for ordered searching
Sorting algorithms for ranking and filtering
Searching algorithms like Binary Search where applicable

⚙️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: javascript and html

IDE / Tools: Vs code

No external frameworks required

🚀 How It Works
Game data is stored in a structured format.
User provides a search query or filter.
Relevant algorithms process the data.
Results are displayed efficiently.

✅ Learning Outcomes
Practical implementation of DSA concepts
Understanding time and space complexity
Designing real-world inspired search systems
Working with structured data efficiently

📈 Future Improvements
Advanced filtering options
Fuzzy search support
Improved UI
Database integration
Recommendation system
